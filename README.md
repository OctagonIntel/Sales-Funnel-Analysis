#  Sales Funnel Data Generation & Analysis

This project simulates a complete sales funnel dataset using Python and performs initial analysis using Excel. It's designed to showcase technical skills in data generation, preprocessing, and readiness for visualization and business insights.


##  Project Overview

I created a **synthetic dataset** of 10,000 leads moving through a standard B2B/B2C sales funnel, including:

- Lead source
- Industry
- Conversion stage (awareness â†’ deal closed)
- Revenue
- Profit
- Country

This dataset was built to:
- Practice and showcase analysis techniques
- Create a realistic, yet flexible dataset for Power BI / Tableau
- Demonstrate readiness for data analyst/business analyst roles
